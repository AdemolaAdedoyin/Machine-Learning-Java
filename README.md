# Machine-Learning-Java
Machine Learning algorithms done using the Java programming language

The TSP Test folder uses both genetic Algorithm and Nearest neighbor algorithm to tackle the Travelling salesman problem, and the TSP simply means finding the shortest possible route between a number of cities. 

The Optical Character recognition folder uses 4 machine learning algorithms to recognize hand written digits, algorithms which are Nearest neighbor, K nearest neighbor, K means and Multilayer Perceptron
